     <h2 class="CodeAbbey">Plans For The Future</h2>
     <p>
       My plans for the future are to finish my degree, whilst continuing to work on programming projects and exercises, to build up my confidence in future interviews aswell as a passion for programming and software development as a whole. <br> <br> Currently I dont have any specific companies I would like to work for, but looking for placements during second year in software engineering sectors I would enjoy would help me find companies of interest.
